     <div class=" blurb e"> Gourmet cook Manako Kajii sits in Tokyo Detention Centre convicted of the serial murders of lonely businessmen,
        who she is said to have seduced with her delicious home cooking. The case has captured the nation’s imagination but Kajii refuses 
        to speak with the press, entertaining no visitors. That is, until journalist Rika Machida writes a letter asking for her recipe for
        beef stew and Kajii can’t resist writing back. <br> Rika, the only woman in her news office, works late each night, rarely cooking more 
        than ramen. As the visits unfold between her and the steely Kajii, they are closer to a masterclass in food than journalistic research.
        Rika hopes this gastronomic exchange will help her soften Kajii but it seems that she might be the one changing. With each meal she eats, 
        something is awakening in her body, might she and Kaji have more in common than she once thought?
        Inspired by the real case of the convicted con woman and serial killer, "The Konkatsu Killer", Asako Yuzuki’s Butter is a vivid, unsettling
        exploration of misogyny, obsession, romance and the transgressive pleasures of food in Japan. <hr width="500px"> </div>

    <div class="review e"> This is a tale of a woman (with a taste for the finer things in life) sent to prisoner for murdering three lovers, and the journalist 
        who is interested in the case. Butter pulls you in from the first line, highlighting the misogyny and unreal standards Japanese woman must face on a day-to-day basis.
        Its a deliciously written novel, that takes some dark turns and twists.
        
        Manako Kajii is awaiting her retrial. All three of her previous lovers have passed away within 6 months of each other, either by accident or suicide.
        These wealthy men funded Kajiis lavish lifestyle, handing over large sums of money. In exchange she fed them sumptuous meals and provided them with a 
        caring, soft, and passive woman. There deaths could have all been a coincidence but Manako Kajii does not fit into the traditional Japanese beauty standards. 
        She is describes as an overweight, unattractive woman by the Japanese media. Kajii views and opinions on what is expected from Japanese women. Kajii is what can 
        only be described as sexist. Harbouring a deep hatred towards women and their lack of femininity 

        In the end, I thought the story rather dragged and didn't come to a definite, rounded ending. I was disappointed to be left in the dark but due to the authors choice, I 
        the reader was forced to focus on the relationship development between the two women and view the impact they had on each other. Although slightly under whelmed with the ending 
        it taught me about Japanese culture towards women within the work-place and family dynamics.
