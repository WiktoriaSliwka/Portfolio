    <div class="blurb b"> Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth in London, chief city of Airstrip One. 
        Big Brother stares out from every poster, the Thought Police uncover every act of betrayal. 
        When Winston finds love with Julia, he discovers that life does not have to be dull and deadening,
        and awakens to new possibilities. Despite the police helicopters that hover and circle overhead,
        Winston and Julia begin to question the Party; they are drawn towards conspiracy. Yet Big Brother
        will not tolerate dissent - even in the mind. For those with original thoughts they invented Room 101 ...
        Nineteen Eight-Four is George Orwell's terrifying vision of a totalitarian future in which everything
        and everyone is slave to a tyrannical regime. <hr width="500px"></div>
        
    <div class="review b"> A masterpiece of rebellion and imprisonment where war is peace freedom is slavery and Big Brother is watching. 
        Thought Police, Big Brother, Orwellian - these words have entered our vocabulary because of George Orwell's classic dystopian novel 
        1984. The story of one man's Nightmare Odyssey as he pursues a forbidden love affair through a world ruled by warring states and a
         power structure that controls not only information but also individual thought and memory 1984 is a prophetic haunting tale More
          relevant than ever before 1984 exposes the worst crimes imaginable the destruction of truth freedom and individuality
