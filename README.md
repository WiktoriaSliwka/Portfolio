Documentation 
Firstly In the index.html i added bootstrap for css to make the cross platform web development more seamless. 
I added a nva bar on top and made it stick to the top of the page so when the user scrolls it will stay there and when used on a mobile/ small screen the nav bar turns into a navbar symbol also known as the hamburger 

i added a title with my name and placed an image link next to it with a placeholder image
Within the project section i created a 3X3 grid to hold the 9 weekly projects with a sample placeholder image 

Home and projects are within their own <section>
